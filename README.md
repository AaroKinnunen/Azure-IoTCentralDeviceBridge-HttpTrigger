# IoT Central Device Bridge -HttpTrigger
 Custom Javascript code for the IoT Central device bridge connecting Digita ThingPark and IoT Central application.
 The code includes also a decoder function for Carlo Gavazzi UWPA connected to ThingPark. The code was part of my thesis about LoRaWAN and remote electricity measurements. The code uses similiar methods than my other repository about ThingsBoard.
